/**
 * Computer AI Controller for Battleship.
 *
 * This class serves as an autonomous wrapper for the computer player,

 *
 * Responsibilities include:
 * - Placing the entire fleet on the board using retry logic to ensure valid placement.
 * - Executing random attacks on the opponent while avoiding duplicate attacks by
 *   tracking previous moves.
 *
 * Constants:
 * - MAX_FLEET_PLACEMENT_ATTEMPTS: Maximum retries to place the entire fleet.
 * - MAX_SHIP_PLACEMENT_ATTEMPTS: Maximum retries to place a single ship.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Instantiate with a computer player object, then call methods to place ships and perform attacks.
